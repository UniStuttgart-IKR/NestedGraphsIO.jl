# NestedGraphsIO.jl

This package provides some additional functionality to [`GraphIO.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphIO.jl).
In particular:
- it provides support for [`NestedGraph.jl`](https://github.com/UniStuttgart-IKR/NestedGraphs.jl)
- it provides attribute support for [`MetaGraphs.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MetaGraphs.jl)
For now only the [graphml](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) format is implemented.

In the future I hope that a nice solution is found to merge this package into `GraphIO.jl`.
Some little discussion [here](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/GraphIO.jl/pull/49).
